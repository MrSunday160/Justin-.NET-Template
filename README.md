# Justin .NET Template
This is my .NET 8 Project Template consisting of 3 projects:    
1. .Api (Controllers and DIs)
2. .DataAccess (Services and DbContexts)
3. .Domain (Models and other related classes)
Everything seems to be working  

# Check out my Library!
https://github.com/MrSunday160/JustinLibrary.git    
This template essentially implements the Library and how it's intended to be used!    

# Thanks ðŸ˜„
